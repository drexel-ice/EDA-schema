## Graph Datamodel Schema

EDA-schema is a property graph data model schema used to represent digital circuits. Netlists and performance reports are extracted from design tools after each stage of the EDA design flow. These files are utilized to derive structural information and performance metrics for each phase. While post-routing netlists and performance metrics are final and complete, earlier stages still provide incomplete yet useful structural information and estimated performance metrics. The data becomes more complete and accurate as the design flow progresses.

A circuit extracted from the design flow is represented as a graph where nodes are IO pins, gates, and wires, and edges are the connections between them. This primary netlist graph representation is complemented by more granular graph representations, such as a timing path graph and an interconnect graph. Together, these representations complete the schema.

Presented is the entity relationship diagram (ERD) of EDA-schema. The primary graph entities—netlist, clock tree, timing path, and interconnect graphs—are highlighted in gold. Additional tabular entities associated with each graph are shown in silver.  For each circuit, a snapshot of data is available for the following design stages/phases.
- Post floorplan: floorplan
- Post global placement: global_placement
- Post detailed placement: detailed_placement
- Post CTS: cts
- Post global routing: global_route
- Post detailed routing: detailed_route

The primary graph entities of the circuit and schema include:

### Netlist Graph (NG)

- The Netlist graph represents comprehensive structural details of digital circuits.
- **Nodes represent**:
  - Input/output ports (IO): These are the entry and exit points of the circuit for signals.
  - Gates (G): These are logical devices that perform basic operations like AND, OR, NOT, etc.
  - Interconnects (I): These are the wires that connect different components.
- **Edges denote** connections between devices and components.
- Gates (G) extend standard cells (SC) with design-specific structural and spatial attributes, capturing more detailed information about each gate's role and connections in the circuit.
