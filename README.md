# EDA-schema

EDA-schema is a property graph datamodel schema developed to represent digital circuit designs and the associated attributes.
The contributions of this work include:
1. A standardized set of graph structures and feature sets representing a digital circuit and corresponding subcomponents
2. A dataset of physical designs generated from the IWLS'05 benchmark circuit suite utilizing the open-source 130 nm Process Design Kit (PDK) provided by Skywater and the open-source toolset OpenROAD

NOTE: This GitHub repository is still in the development phase. We are actively working on adding new features, fixing bugs, and enhancing the overall functionality. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to finalize the project.


## Graph Datamodel Schema

EDA-schema is a property graph data-model schema used to represent digital circuits. Netlists and performance reports are extracted from design tools after each stage of the EDA design flow. These files are utilized to derive structural information and performance metrics for each phase. While post-routing netlists and performance metrics are final and complete, earlier stages still provide incomplete yet useful structural information and estimated performance metrics. The data becomes more complete and accurate as the design flow progresses.

A circuit extracted from the design flow is represented as a graph where nodes are IO pins, gates, and wires, and edges are the connections between them. This primary netlist graph representation is complemented by more granular graph representations, such as a timing path graph and an interconnect graph. Together, these representations complete the schema.

Presented is the entity relationship diagram (ERD) of EDA-schema. The primary graph entities—netlist, clock tree, timing path, and interconnect graphs—are highlighted in gold. Additional tabular entities associated with each graph are shown in silver. For each circuit, data is available for four states: post floorplan, post placement, post CTS, and post routing.

## Open Dataset
A comprehensive dataset for physical design is comprised of four key components:
1) Design circuits: selected [IWLS'05 benchmark circuits](https://github.com/ieee-ceda-datc/RDF-2020/tree/master/benchmarks/iwls05_opencores)
2) Process Development Kit (PDK): [Skywater 130 nm](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/)
3) Physical Design Toolset: [OpenROAD](https://theopenroadproject.org/)
4) Design parameters and Constraints:
